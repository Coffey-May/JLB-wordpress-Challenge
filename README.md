## Install

- To begin, I first downloaded and installed MAMP. Then I downloaded and installed the most recent version of wordpress.

## Theme and Child theme

- For the second portion of the challenge I created a child theme from the 2022 storefront template and followed the steps to inherit from the parent theme.

## Create demo products and attributes

- My next goal included the creation of demo products and associated attributes. I completed this by using the dashboard controls of wordpress.

## Alter funtion.php file to display filter by attribute of products on archive page

- My next goal included displaying products with a filter by attribute feature on the archive page. I achieved this by using a redirect in the function.php file and also applying a widget.

## Create repository and Push

- I used the integrated terminal of VSCode to stage, commit, and push my files to GitHub.
